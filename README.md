# Professonal-Profile-

I created this web profile to show everybody my ability to code and who I am.  You have links to my Linkedin, resume and github pages.  

## About Me

This page is about me, my history and what I would like to do in the future.  As with all the pages it has a navagation bar at the top that will take you around the website.

### Projects

On this page you can see the projects and home work I have worked on.  Dream Destination is the first group project we had in class and I really enjoyed doing it.  History Quiz and Passsword Generator are both homework assignments that we did using JavaScript.  I also wanted to show how this webpage has evolved since I started it at the start of class.  You also have a link to my github page in this section.

#### Contact Me

# Problems

The hardest issues I faced was getting everything lined up, information boxes where I wanted them, and links to go to the correct sites.  The navbar was also tricky getting all the navagation links in there as well.
